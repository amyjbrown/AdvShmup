# MiniMarkup
This is a file on the Minimarkup minimarkup language, it's specs, and it's behavior and implementation

What is MiniMarkup?
MiniMarkup is a mini-markup language used for basic pygame text rendering facilities lacking in the core SDL library

All MiniMarkup files are ASCII or UTF-8 encoded text files, or appropriate strings

All markup files are composed of the following:
* Text, or Glyphs: Basic UTF-8 Encoded text glyphs,
* Control Characters, like /n [Technically Text, but treated in a special way
* Tags, of the form '<'...'>'

These tags let you perform special operations on the text as it's being drawn, as well as higher level functions, from
text itself
