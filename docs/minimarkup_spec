All unicode LtR characters should be supported, but that is undefined for now

List of Tags and Operations, Notes
//Globals, those that can only be set once
<canvas = n, m> CORE
Sets the local canvas text is written on in terms of pixels (for now)

<origin = x, y> CORE
point of origin where local Surface will be pasted onto Target surface
NONCORE
Absent, this value is to be

<anchor = t> CORE
what point the local surface will use as the "Origin"
Types include Left, Right, Top, Bottom, TL, TR, BL, BR, Center
If this tag is absent, value = TL

1---2---3
|   |   |
4---5---6
|   |   |
7---8---9
1=TL, 2 T, 3 TR, 4 L, 5 C, etc


<def_color = color>
Default color value
If this tag is absent, default = (255,255,255) BLACK
Type can either be a name (like RED) or a 3tuple of R,G,B

//Local
Font Types: All font types (italic, bold, underline) are off by default)

<i>
Set the Drawer to use the Italic font version, hence all text following <i> but before an optional </t> is italic
</i>
set the Drawer to use the non-italic font

<b></b>
Set the following text before any </b> to be bold

<u=n></u>
Set the following text before an optional </u> to be underlined by width N (default is always non-underlined)

<norm>
Sets text to non-Italic, non-Bold, and non-Underline

Aliases: TODO

<default>
Set everything (font size, text types, color, etc.) to the defaults
-------------------------------------------------------------------
NonCore, Experimental
<margins= l, t, r> GLOBAL
Puts down the Left (l), Top(t), and Right (r) margins
Default values if not-implemented 0,0,0

<align = S >, </align>
Align the text following the tag according to direction
Left or L left aligns, Right or R right-aligns, Center or C is center aligned
Justified is too much for this sort of work
<de_align = S>
Default Alignment Style

Other Details or Ideas
Number Spec -
In dealing with screenspace, values can be set as either Np (N pixels), Nr (N relative screenspace)
maybe Ng for N (average) glyphs?

<speed = T> maybe Global? It'd be hellish for some of my other features
Default rendering speed, that is, delay between glyph rendering
Value of 0 means there is no delay and it fully draws it
Unknown if this should be global, since you can easily change the delay counter, and have it be global, e.g. SUPERFAST
Maybe Delete Text as you move through it if T is negative?
