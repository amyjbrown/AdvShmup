This design document is a small but concise summary of my game design goals

Overview
A relatively mature architectured game
A deterministic scrolling space shooter with fixed levels, score attack, and high scores killing strange bio-organic
foes

Gameplay loop:
    The play plays a small fighter moving through a vertically scrolling shooter
    Enemies, debris and powerups spawn over time, threatening the player and giving them potential goals
    The player has a health bar and can get health pickups

Game Mechanics:
    Player has a small, maneuverable fighter that can produce a constant bullet stream with no cost
    The player can fire MISSILES with limited ammo, and sometimes screen clearing BOMBS
    MISSILES do large amount of damage in a small splash damage region
    Enemies attack the player by either SHOOTING or RAMMING the player, causing the player to loose HEALTH
    ASTEROIDS also cause damage, but are more easily maneuvered around
    If the PLAYER HEALTH becomes Zero, they will loose a CONTINUE
    If the player has no CONTINUES, they must start the level over
    Over time, health pickups, score pickups, and missiles will drop for the player

Implementation Goals:
    One static and one random scrolling game level
    Player can move and shoot bullets through level
    Game ends when player finishes level
    Score is recorded in local highscore table
    Enemies have animation and an explosion death animation
    Three enemies:
        +Swarming melee
        +Ranged enemies
        +Asteroids
    Powerups:
        +Health Token
        + Score Token

Resources needed:
    ~ player anim
    + health token
    ~ swarm enemy
    - shoot enemy
    - gold token
    - ui
